### What is Markdown?

[Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) is a way to style text on the web. _You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *._
